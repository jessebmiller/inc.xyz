## How to get involved

I'm looking for a few people to get involved because everything is left to do.

* The site needs to be made presentable and usable, then
  [relentlessly improved](https://github.com/jessebmiller/inc.xyz/issues)
* The legal requirements need to be identified and dealt with

### Authors

I want to hear from you, because this is for you! Is this something you could
use? What do you need to self publish?

### Developers

You can help build the platform, It'll need you. PRs welcome.

### Lawers

I don't know what the legal requirements for something like this would be.
